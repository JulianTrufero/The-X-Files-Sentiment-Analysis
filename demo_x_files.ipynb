      "By reputation. He s an Oxford educated Psychologist, who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult, that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988. Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crimes section. He had a nickname at the academy... Spooky Mulder.\n",

      "Am I to understand that you want me to debunk the X-Files project, sir?\n",
      "Agent Mulder. I m Dana Scully, I ve been assigned to work with you.\n",

      "It s organic. I don t know, is it some kind of synthetic protein?\n",
      "Do you have a theory?\n",
      "Logically, I would have to say  no. \n",
      "The girl obviously died of something. If it was natural causes, it s plausible that there was something missed in the post-mortem. If she was murdered, it s plausible there was a sloppy investigation. What I find fantastic is any notion that there are answers beyond the realm of science. The answers are there. You just have to know where to look.\n",
      "You didn t mention yesterday, this case has already been investigated.\n",
      "And you found something they didn t.\n",
      "The autopsy reports of the first three victims, show no unidentified marks or tissue samples. But those reports were signed by a different medical examiner than the latest victim.\n",

      "There has got to be an explanation. You ve got four victims. All of them died in or near the woods. They found Karen Swenson s body in the forest in her pajamas, ten miles from her house. How did she get there? What were those kids doing out there in the forest?\n",
      "Mulder?\n",
      "We are conducting an investigation.\n",
      "Maybe it has something to do with this.\n",
      "It was all over the ground. I think something is going on out here, some kind of a sacrifice, maybe. What if these kids are involved in some kind of occult and that man knows something about it?\n",

      "We lost what?\n",

      "We lost the original sample in the fire. What else could it be?\n",
      "You said it yourself.\n",
      "You re right. We ll take another sample from the forest... and run a comparison before we do anything.\n",
      "The detective s here. What do you think?\n",
      "Mulder, what happened? There was a light.\n",
      "Yes, sir. My reports are personal and subjective. I don t think I ve gone so far as to draw any conclusion about what I ve seen.\n",
      "I can t substantiate it, no.\n",
      "There were, of course, crimes committed.\n",

      "Hello?\n",
      "Y, yes. Tomorrow.\n",
      "Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI s most unwanted.\n",
      "Oh, isn t it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who did you tick off to get stuck with this detail, Scully?\n",
      "Oh, really? I was under the impression... that you were sent to spy on me.\n",
      "You re a medical doctor, you teach at the academy. You did your undergraduate degree in physics.\n",
      "I did. I liked it.\n",
      "How s your chemistry? This is the substance found in the surrounding tissue.\n",
      "Beats me, I ve never seen it before either.\n",
      "I have plenty of theories.\n",
      "Conventional wisdom. You know this Oregon female? She s the fourth person in her graduating class to die under mysterious circumstances. Now, when convention and science offer us no answers, might we not finally turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?\n",
      "That s why they put the  I  in  F.B.I.  See you tomorrow morning, Scully, bright and early.\n",
      "This must be the place.\n",
      "Yeah, the FBI got involved after the first three deaths when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence. Our boys came out here, spent a week, enjoyed the local salmon which, with a little lemon twist, is just to die for, if you ll pardon the expression. Without explanation, they were called back in. The case was reclassified and buried in the X-Files, till I dug it up last week.\n",
      "Mmm. (as if to say  yes. )\n",
      "That s pretty good, Scully.\n",
      "Well... I ll let you know when we get past the easy part.\n",
      "We won t know that until we do a little gravedigging. I ve arranged to exhume one of the other victims  bodies to see if we can get a tissue sample to match the girl s. You re not squeamish about that kind of thing, are ya?\n",
      "Oh, you know... probably nothing.\n",
      "Yeah, hi.\n",
      "How soon can we get started?\n",
      "Oh great.\n",
      "Were you able to arrange for a, uh... an examination facility?\n",
      "Ah...\n",
      "I m sorry, you are...\n",
      "Surely, you must have been informed of our intentions to come up here.\n",
      "Oh, oh. Well, that answers the question that we had. Why you hadn t done the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson. You re aware of the tissue sample that was taken from the girl s body.\n",
      "Guy obviously needed a longer vacation.\n",
      "Soames actually confessed to the first two murders. He pleaded to be locked up but he couldn t produce any evidence that he committed the crimes. Did you happen to read the cause of death?\n",
      "Missing for only seven hours in July. How does a twenty-year-old boy die of exposure on a warm summers night in Oregon, Doctor Scully?\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "This is amazing, Scully. You know what this could mean? It s almost too big to even comprehend.\n",
      "If it s not human, what is it?\n",
      "Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soames  grave? Try telling that to the good townsfolk or to Ray Soames  family. I want tissue samples and x-rays. I d like blood type and toxicology and a full genetic work-up.\n",
      "What we can t do here, we ll order to go.\n",
      "We can do those x-rays here, can t we? Is there any reason we can t do them right now? I m not crazy, Scully. I have the same doubts you do.\n",
      "Steven Spielberg.\n",
      "You figure out what that little thing up Ray Soames  nose is yet?\n",
      "Is that something you ve seen before?\n",
      "We re trying to find a connection in these deaths. Did you treat any of these kids with hypnosis?\n",
      "Does he like it when you read to him?\n",
      "Doctor. I m wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam on Peggy.\n",
      "No one is going to hurt you!\n",
      "What s his name, er... Billy said he was sorry he didn t get to say goodbye.\n",
      "I don t know, lucky guess?\n",
      "Why? So you can put it down in your little report? I don t think you re ready for what I think. (They stop walking.)\n",
      "The truth? I think those kids have been abducted.\n",
      "By what.\n",
      "Do you have a better explanation?\n",
      "Nothing scientific, you mean.\n",
      "Hold on! This is a crime scene.\n",
      "What s he doing out here all by himself?\n",
      "I don t know. Is it a campfire?\n",
      "Yeah, I m just, er...\n",
      "We lost power, brakes, steering, everything.\n",
      "Nine minutes. I looked at my watch just before the flash and it was nine-o-three. It just turned nine-thirteen.\n",
      "Gone! Just like that.\n",
      "Not in this zipcode.\n",
      " HOTEL ROOM\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Come on in.\n",
      "Mosquito bites.\n",
      "Yeah. I got eaten up a lot myself out there.\n",
      "You re shaking.\n",
      "Take your time.\n",
      "Tore the family apart. No one would talk about it. There were no facts to confirm, nothing to offer any hope.\n",
      "Eventually, I went off to school in England, I came back, got recruited by the bureau. Seems I had a natural aptitude for applying behavioural models to criminal cases.\n",
      "At first, it looked like a garbage dump for UFO sightings, alien abduction reports, the kind of stuff that most people laugh at as being ridiculous. But I was fascinated. I read all the cases I could get my hands on, hundreds of them. I read everything I could about paranormal phenomenon, about the occult and...\n",
      "There s classified government information I ve being trying to access, but someone has been blocking my attempts to get at it.\n",
      "Someone at a higher level of power. The only reason I ve been allowed to continue with my work is because I ve made connections in congress.\n",
      "You re a part of that agenda, you know that.\n",
      "I m telling you this, Scully, because you need to know, because of what you ve seen. In my research, I ve worked very closely with a man named Dr. Heitz Werber and he s taken me through deep regression hypnosis. I ve been able to go into my own repressed memories to the night my sister disappeared. I can recall a bright light outside and a presence in the room. I was paralyzed, unable to respond to my sister s calls for help.\n",
      "The government knows about it, and I got to know what they re protecting. Nothing else matters to me, and this is as close as I ve ever gotten to it.\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "She was running? On foot?\n",
      "Let s go, let s go.\n",
      "F.B.I.\n",
      "Damn it! The x-rays and pictures!\n",
      "Come with us.\n",
      "How long has it been happening?\n",
      "Your father s the medical examiner. You were the one on the phone, you told me Peggy O Dell had been killed.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Do you have the marks, Theresa?\n",
      "I don t think she wants to leave.\n",
      "You re Billy Miles  father?\n",
      "Eh, you gotta love this place. Everyday s like Halloween.\n",
      "They know something.\n",
      "Why would they destroy evidence? What would they want with that corpse?\n",
      "Makes you wonder what s in those other two graves.\n",
      "They re both empty.\n",
      "I think I know who did it. I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.\n",
      "The detective s son. Billy Miles.\n",
      "Peggy O Dell was bound to a wheelchair but she ran in front of that truck. Look, I m not making this up, it all fits the profile of alien abduction.\n",
      "Yes. Peggy O Dell was killed at around nine-o-clock, that s right around the time we lost nine minutes on the highway, I think that something happened in that nine minutes. I think that time, as we know it, stopped. And something took control over it.\n",
      "That s the reason the kids come to the forest, because the forest controls them and summons them there. And, and, and the marks are from, from some kind of test that s being done on them. And, and that may be causing some kind of genetic mutation which would explain the body that we dug up.\n",
      "Yes, but it was Billy Miles who took her there, summoned by some alien impulse. That s it!\n",
      "We re going to pay a visit to Billy Miles.\n",
      "I guess you changed his bedpan last night.\n",
      "You noticed nothing unusual? Do you remember what you were doing last night around nine-o-clock?\n",
      "Do you remember what you were watching?\n",
      "Do you know who was taking care of Peggy O Dell last night?\n",
      "Thank you for your time, ma am.\n",
      "Good day.\n",
      "Scully...\n",
      "You re sure?\n",
      "Okay, then maybe we should take it and run a lab test...\n",
      "All right, but I just want you to understand what it is you re saying.\n",
      "Yeah, but you have to write it down in your report.\n",
      "There were screams...\n",
      "You know it s Billy. You ve known it all along.\n",
      "How long are you gonna let it happen?\n",
      "Scully.\n",
      "It was incredible.\n",
      "Scully? It s me, I haven t been able to sleep. I talked to the D.A. s office in Raymon County, Oregon. There s no case file on Billy Miles. The paperwork we filed is gone. We need to talk, Scully.\n",
      "Hi. I got your message.\n",
      "It s two-o-clock in the afternoon Agent Mulder.\n",
      "Something you couldn t show me at work.\n",
      "Which was what, exactly?\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own pilots?\n",
      "Yeah, there were rumors those pilots were shot down at high altitudes, while they were routinely penetrating Russian air space.\n",
      "So?\n",
      "I don t get it Mulder. Does this have something to do with an X-File? I thought you only liked those, er, paranormal type cases. Am I missing something here?\n",
      "You ok Mulder?\n",
      "Mulder?\n",
      "I checked on that file you gave me.\n",
      "You failed to tell me a few things. (Mulder hears clicking noises coming from his phone, he takes the phone away from his ear) This isn t some UFO goose chase, you re leading me on, is it? (Mulder listens into the phone again) Are you there Mulder?\n",
      "Did you hear what I said, because the bureau has it out for us already and it would make us appear pretty stupid if my field report, read like some tabloid story.\n",
      "How do you mean?\n",
      "Did you ever talk to him about this?\n",
      "You know that the government is not above the law. They cannot withhold information.\n",
      "How long has he been...\n",
      "We ll be staying at the Beech Grove Motel if you anything, ok?\n",
      "Mmm, it s called sterioptathy, it s a syndrome produced by extreme stress. POWs have been known to suffer from it, they ve studied it in zoo animals.\n",
      "Ever hear of something called The Aurora Project?\n",
      "The Pentagon has all but admitted, they ve been testing a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft over the western US. Maybe, these guys are flying those planes. Maybe, these guys are the washouts.\n",
      "OVE MOTEL SCULLY S ROOM\n",
      "Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us, a week from Friday.\n",
      "Good thing we still kept that appointment.\n",
      "Sucker.\n",
      "Catch ye outside.\n",
      "Wanna see something weird, Mulder? Ellens Air Base isn t even on my US GS quadrant map.\n",
      "You know. Where are we going?\n",
      "What do you honestly hope to see?\n",
      "Is this why we came out here, Mulder? To look for UFOs. (Mulder is walking up a grassy embankment) Yea, this is gonna look real good on my field report.\n",
      "Aaaaaah!\n",
      "Unnh!\n",
      "What are they?\n",
      "That s unreal. I ve never seen anything like it.\n",
      "Well, it can t be aircraft. Aircraft can t maneuver like that.\n",
      "I don t know, lasers maybe. Being shot from the ground, reflecting up off the clouds. (The two lights fly up through the clouds and disappear. Scully turns to face Mulder, her expression is one of amazement) Oh my God.\n",
      "That s not a plane, that s a helicopter.\n",
      "So, what exactly were you guys doing in there?\n",
      "What s that?\n",
      "You believe it all, don t you?\n",
      "Mulder, did you see their eyes? If I were that stoned I...\n",
      "Mulder, you could have shown that kid a picture of a flying hamburger and he would have told you that s exactly what he saw.\n",
      "Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs.\n",
      "Mulder, c mon. You ve got two blurry photos, one of them taken almost fifty years ago, and another one, you purchased today in a roadside diner. You re going out on a pretty big limb.\n",
      "Tell me, one good reason why either of these photos is authentic.\n",
      "Just because I can t explain it, doesn t mean I m gonna believe they were UFOs.\n",
      "Mulder, you re crazy. (Mulder chuckles) And it still doesn t explain to me, what happened to Colonel Budahas.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "You ready for this.\n",
      "We got a message from Mrs. Budahas, her husband came home last night.\n",
      "We got your message.\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Mulder, would you explain to me what s going on.\n",
      "The brain doesn t work like that, Mulder. You can t just go in and erase certain files.\n",
      "There are types of amnesia th..\n",
      "All I m saying, is that the science or medical technology to do what you are suggesting, does not exist.\n",
      "Even if they could, why would they do such a thing?\n",
      "It couldn t just be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse?\n",
      "What the hell is th..\n",
      "Federal Agents.\n",
      "Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356, no plate registered under that number. Thanks Gayle, no, I m sure the other one s bogus too, bye. (Mulder is lying on the bed) So who were those guys?\n",
      "Something else.\n",
      "What!\n",
      "If, if that were true, it would be a national scandal.\n",
      "Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply an experimental plane. Like the stealth bomber or, this Aurora Project. Doesn t the government have a right and a responsibility, to protect it s secrets?\n",
      "Look, these are questions we have no business asking. Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding. Let s get out of here Mulder, while you still have a job.\n",
      "Mulder, where are you going?\n",
      "Yeah, I m, I m trying to make a call to Washington D.C. an, and I can t seem to get a long-distance line. (Her phone suddenly goes dead) Hello? Hello? (Scully puts the phone down beside her holstered gun and goes over to the motel reception office) Excuse me. Erm, my phone s not working, can I use yours to make a credit card call, please?\n",
      "This one s not working either.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "I was in the lobby trying to make a call.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Get on the car. Hands on the car, do it.\n",
      "I said, hands against the car. Who are you?\n",
      "Where s Mulder?\n",
      "I want you to get on that walkie-talkie and find out where Mulder is.\n",
      "I think you can, or I m gonna have every newspaper in America out here, writing about your experimental aircraft.\n",
      "Yeah, I ve already seen where you get with tears and a sad story.\n",
      "What are we doing?\n",
      "I want the car running. I said start the car. (Paul starts the car) And put your hands on the wheel, where I can see them.\n",
      "Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.\n",
      "I want you to keep the car running, and step out of the car. (Both Paul and Scully get out of the car, Scully keeps the gun pointed at Paul as she moves around the car and behind him) Get in the car Mulder. Get in the car.\n",
      "You ok Mulder?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "That s enough Mulder. We don t know anything. Anything more than when we got here, and that s what I gonna write in my field report. Let s get outta here Mulder, as fast as we can.\n",
      "Sorry for the run around. Can I buy you a drink?\n",
      "It s not stopping the rest of these people. I got something to show you.\n",
      "Let s get a table. (Mulder and Scully make their way through the crowded bar. We see many people sitting at the bar, but one particular man seems to be watching Mulder and Scully. Scully is looking through a file, we see a photo of a man, the same man we saw trembling in his home at the start, in a military uniform) That s Colonel Robert Budahas. That photo was taken last year when he was a test pilot for the military, stationed at Ellens Air Base in Southwest Idaho. Four months ago, Colonel Budahas experienced a psychotic episode and barricaded himself in his home. Military police were called in. Budahas was removed and apparently hospitalised with treatment of his condition.\n",
      "The military will not comment on the cause, nature or status. In fact, the military will not comment on Colonel Budahas at all.\n",
      "Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months. Her inquiries to the military have gone unanswered. Last month, she contacted the FBI and reported it as a kidnapping.\n",
      "That s the sixty-four thousand dollar question, Scully. (Mulder passes Scully some new information, a thick pile of papers) Since 1963, six pilots have been listed as missing in action, from Ellens Air Base. The military will say only that these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft.\n",
      "There were other rumors too. I ve been tracking this case since it came through the Boise regional office last month. Last week, for reasons I can t figure out, it was deprioritized. They shelved this case without an investigation, Scully.\n",
      "So, you and I, are going to the spud state to investigate a little kidnapping.\n",
      "Let s just say, this case has a, distinct smell to it, a certain, paranormal bouquet. Excuse me.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Who are you?\n",
      "How do you know about my work?\n",
      "Who are you? Who do you work for?\n",
      "I can t do that.\n",
      "Yeah, I m fine.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Er, listen, I don t want to talk about it on this line. I ll, I ll talk to you about it, on the flight out, OK?\n",
      "Mrs. Budahas?\n",
      "We re from the FBI.\n",
      "What kinds of things?\n",
      "Did he ever talk about his work?\n",
      "Eeh, you said word gets around, I m sorry, erm, have you ever heard of this, happening to anyone else?\n",
      "Mrs. McLennen, has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this?\n",
      "So what did you make of Uncle Fester down the block?\n",
      "Yeah, but these guys aren t zoo animals, they re test pilots. They re not supposed to fold under pressure, they re supposed to thrive on it.\n",
      "Yeah, that s the, er, unacknowledged codename for some new kind of defense department, surveillance project.\n",
      "You saw the photos on the wall in there. This guy Budahas received a presidential commendation, he s never washed out of anything in his life.\n",
      "I ve been on hold with the base director of communications for forty-five minutes, how about you?\n",
      "Yeah, right. (Mulder lifts up a telephone directory) Did you say Kissel?\n",
      "Colonel Kissel?\n",
      "Can I talk with you? Special Agent Mulder, FBI.\n",
      "Why don t you talk to us about Colonel Budahas?\n",
      "We re just looking around.\n",
      "We re not at liberty to comment.\n",
      "Paul? Right? You ve lived in this area a while, you ever seen a UFO?\n",
      "But, if I wanted to talk to those UFO nuts, that you referred to earlier, where would I go?\n",
      "Who s the photographer?\n",
      "You re kidding, where?\n",
      "Put it on my tab.\n",
      "What would the chances be, of someone like me, seeing a UFO?\n",
      "I know. Let s go.\n",
      "We got our own map, sucker.\n",
      "I don t know, maybe nothing.\n",
      "Scully, wake up. You ve gotta see this.\n",
      "I don t know, just keep watching it s unbelievable.\n",
      "They ve been going at it like that for almost half an hour.\n",
      "What else could they be?\n",
      "Here comes another one.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Stay right there.\n",
      "Come on.\n",
      "Let s go, you re coming with us.\n",
      "Were you ever chased out before?\n",
      "What do you think they are?\n",
      "Do they look anything like this?\n",
      "Later Dude!\n",
      "Evidence. (Mulder puts the tape in the stereo and the sound of heavy metal guitar music fills the car. Scully turns it off) Kids today, huh.\n",
      "Why wouldn t I?\n",
      "Ho-hoo. If you were that stoned, what.\n",
      "Alright, I wanna show you something. (Mulder reaches into the back seat of the car and lifts a folder, he opens it and takes out a photo, which he gives to Scully) This is a photo, of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now I know, you don t believe that story but just hear me out. Now, Ellens Air Base, the same base that we re at right now, the same base, that for some strange reason, doesn t appear on your US government map, is supposedly, one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.\n",
      "No, planes built, using UFO technology.\n",
      "Tell me, there isn t a remarkable resemblance.\n",
      "You saw exactly what I saw in the sky tonight. What do you think they were?\n",
      "Unidentified Flying Objects, I think that fits the description pretty well. Tell me I m crazy.\n",
      "You didn t come to raid my mini-bar, did ye?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Mrs. Budahas, are you ok?\n",
      "What? What s wrong?\n",
      "It s ok, it s ok, just relax, wel, I m Special Agent Mulder, from the FBI. We re out here investigating your disappearance Colonel Budahas. Wondering if you have any explanation of your whereabouts over the past four months.\n",
      "Here, on base?\n",
      "Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birthdate?\n",
      "And the names of your kids?\n",
      "Green Bay fan.\n",
      "Bet you remember the Super Bowl of 68, huh? Don Shandler.\n",
      "Colonel, Colonel Budahas, you re a, a pilot, isn t that right?\n",
      "Bet you ve flown just about everything with two wings. I got this hotshot pilot friend, who said that he could do Immelmann at a sustained eight g s, huh, is that possible?\n",
      "I think they re-wired that man s brain. Some kind of selective memory drain.\n",
      "Then you explain it to me.\n",
      "This is not amnesia, I think it s something far more deliberate and insidious.\n",
      "And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we saw last night. Listen to me Scully, they can do this. That man, he should have known the answer to the question, it just wasn t in his head anymore.\n",
      "To control information. I think that after his psychotic episode, Colonel Budahas became a security risk.\n",
      "No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas are physiologically incapable of dealing with the stress of flying the aircraft we saw. Or doing those maneuvers, at those speeds. I mean we re talking about a technology that is so sensitive and advanced, that it s taken almost fifty years to make it work. UFO technology, Scully.\n",
      "Hold on.\n",
      "You think if maybe we ignore him, he ll go away?\n",
      "Guess not. (Mulder gets out of the car) Special Agent Mulder, FBI.\n",
      "You wanna tell me what this is about.\n",
      "I don t think it was those kids they were chasing away from the base last night, I think it was us. They knew we were coming before we ever arrived. And they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy. There s something I didn t tell you, Scully.\n",
      "I was approached by a man in D.C. who warned me to stay away from this case, he didn t give me his name, and my phone was being tapped.\n",
      "Why would they go to all this trouble? Out of a need for security. Security of what? I think there s a huge conspiracy here Scully. They ve got a UFO here, I m sure of it. And they ll do anything to keep it a secret, including sacrificing lives and minds of those pilots, because what if that secret got out.\n",
      "No no, you re not thinking big enough, if it were true, it would be confirmation of the existence of extra terrestrial life.\n",
      "Yes, but at what cost, when does the human cost become too high for the building of a better machine?\n",
      "Aren t you even curious? (Scully takes the photo from Mulder and sits down) Aaerm, I gonna shower, I ll pack and then, we ll get outta here.\n",
      "Hey, aren t you guys coming?\n",
      "Ok, this spot you told me about where you watch the air show, how far is it?\n",
      "Will I be able to find it?\n",
      "And what about this other place you told me about, Yellow Base, where they hangar them.\n",
      "Nooo.\n",
      "I think so. Scully I...\n",
      "How did I get here?\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "We came by to see how your husband was doing.\n",
      "Do you think, maybe, we could see him.\n",
      "They got to her Scully. They were here, they must have threatened her and Budahas..\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "I saw something I...\n",
      "What is your interest?\n",
      "I did see something, but it s gone, they took it from me, they erased it. You have to tell me what it was.\n",
      "Because, all the evidence to the contrary, is not entirely dissuasive.\n",
      "They re here, aren t they?\n",
      "Death by hypovolemia. 95  blood loss. That s over 4 liters of blood.\n",
      "The man s daughter, 8 years old... was away from his side for no more than 10 minutes. She doesn t remember anything, there was no trace evidence found at the crime scene.\n",
      "Oh, there were two small puncture wounds.\n",
      "How could that be?\n",
      "But there was no sign of a struggle. How could a man just sit through a blood letting?\n",
      "Wait a minute. These X-Files indicate UFO related phenomena. Often there are related sightings in the sky near the incidences, along with surface burns...\n",
      "Mulder, why would alien beings travel light years through space in order to play doctor on cattle?\n",
      "Can we talk to her now?\n",
      "Hi. I know you must be feeling really sad right now. And scared. But we want to find out what happened so we can help stop whoever hurt your daddy. Okay?\n",
      "Okay. Did you ever see any strangers with your daddy at home?\n",
      "Did you ever see... anyone yell at your daddy or your daddy yell at them?\n",
      "Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your daddy?\n",
      "Scully... Where?\n",
      "Mulder...\n",
      "There s been another one.\n",
      "The victim, Doug Reardon, was married with one daughter. Cause of death, hypovolemia. Mulder, this is crazy. They also found traces of the poison digitalis.\n",
      "Ah... yes. On the jugular. Time of death was estimated at 2:30 p.m. Same day, only three hours earlier than the Simmons murder.\n",
      "It appears we have two serial killers working in tandem.\n",
      "Mulder, nothing beyond your leading questions to Teena Simmons substantiates a UFO mutilation theory.\n",
      "Yes... The police report states that she remembers nothing. Ah... she s with her mother and family in Sacramento.\n",
      "Tomorrow.\n",
      "She was kidnaped from the Social Services Home around 11 p.m. last night. Looks like someone was afraid she might remember too much.\n",
      "Connecticut State Troopers set up road blocks within a half an hour. Nothing.\n",
      "I told them to contact us if they happen to find her.\n",
      "Teena?\n",
      "What s your name?\n",
      "May I ask... Was Cindy adopted?\n",
      "So, I assume you have all the proper documentation. Birth certificate...\n",
      "No. Mrs. Reardon. This is not your daughter. That girl s name is Teena Simmons. She lives 3,000 miles away in Connecticut. That man, her father, was killed in the same manner as your husband.\n",
      "Do you still believe this is UFO related? Cindy Reardon didn t see Red Lightening.\n",
      "Well, there seems to be the random possibility that two people can have an unrelated likeness.\n",
      "The girls are the one and only link between identical murders.\n",
      "Kidnaped.\n",
      "Where are you going?\n",
      "And you expect the pattern to continue.\n",
      "Okay. I ll call the San Francisco bureau and get someone to relieve you.\n",
      "Could a patient have believed she was receiving her own eggs but actually receive another without her knowledge?\n",
      "Are you ever aware of having patients by the name of Claudia and Joel Simmons?\n",
      "Both the Simmons are dead. And their daughter has been kidnaped. I think any information that you have that could help overrides your policy.\n",
      "You have copies of their records sent to Greenwich, CT, in 1991... They came here 9 years ago under the supervision of a Dr. Sally Kendrick?\n",
      "There a problem?\n",
      "And now you don t sound too thrilled.\n",
      "Did you report this to the AMA?\n",
      "And what happened?\n",
      "Dr. Kendrick was the supervising physician in both the Reardon s and Simmons  IVF program. It seems she was experimenting at the clinic.\n",
      "Well, she must have had an accomplice to have done both murders.\n",
      "Mulder, does this mean you ve abandoned your UFO connection? (to phone) Hello?\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Just a couple of clicks. Must be the wrong number.\n",
      "Mulder, you re rushing me out of the room.\n",
      "You got a girl coming over?\n",
      "Why the flashlights?\n",
      "Sally Kendrick...\n",
      "Are you Sally Kendrick?\n",
      "Did you work for the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine in 1985?\n",
      "My God. It s the girls.\n",
      "Until I heard that, I was beginning to suspect the girls.\n",
      "You suppose these girls have any idea of what they are?\n",
      "Mulder, let s go.\n",
      "There s someone upstairs, wait outside.\n",
      "Suspect s name is Sally Kendrick. Early 40 s, 5 8, 135 pounds. Now she may have an accomplice, similar in appearance. Kendrick is driving a light blue  93 Corolla. She has exceptional strength for her size. So you must consider her armed and dangerous. Quite possibly she ll display severe psychotic behavior. The Oakland Bureau was here to orchestrate a search across the bridge.\n",
      "And then what do we do?\n",
      "Okay, good. I want you to start a check on every single passenger for every flight that left the terminal over the past twelve hours. I want you to check every single terminal to make sure she s not hiding out somewhere for a later flight. And remember, she may have an accomplice.\n",
      "We just found the car at the airport.\n",
      "Someone else could have picked up the little girl without the manager knowing about it. The place is crawling with vacationing families. There would be hundreds of little kids running around.\n",
      "That s it.\n",
      "Who s they?\n",
      "It s alright. We ll take care of you. You re safe with us.\n",
      "Looks like the Eves mixed about 4 ounces of digitalis in each glass.\n",
      "It has a sweet flavor. It s probably not even perceptible in soda.\n",
      "We could take them to get checked out by a doctor.\n",
      "We re going to take you back.\n",
      "They ve already grown so attached. It s going to be hard when Teena gets placed in foster care.\n",
      "I could use some caffeine.\n",
      "Let s go.\n",
      "Um, tastes syrupy.\n",
      "SCULLY!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Mulder...\n",
      "We didn t drink enough to make us sick.\n",
      "SCULLY! I GOT THEM!\n",
      "SCULLY!\n",
      "We are the police.\n",
      "Mulder!\n",
      "Did you see the twins we were with?\n",
      "I d say the man was running on empty.\n",
      "Any evidence would have be washed away by yesterday s rain.\n",
      "Are you at all familiar with the phenomena of cattle mutilations?\n",
      "Since 1967, over 34 states have reported unsolved cases of cattle mutilations. Trace evidence is remarkably similar. Incision marks of surgical precision. The area around the mouth and often the sexual organs have been removed. There s a substantial degree of blood loss but not a trace of blood at the scene.\n",
      "Exsanguination. If you were to stick a needle into the jugular of any living creature, the heart itself would act as a pump. These animals have had their jugulars punctured the same as the man in Greenwich, CT. Although this is the first time I ve ever seen it on a human being.\n",
      "The ME found traces of digitalis, a South American plant that can be used as a paralytic drug.\n",
      "Witnesses often relate time loss. We ve seen this in abduction cases. That might explain why the girl can t remember anything.\n",
      "For the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys. Besides, they seem to have stepped up their interest.\n",
      "Has she spoken about it?\n",
      "Any nightmares?\n",
      "Nice bunny, Teena. Can we talk about what happened that day? About what happened in the back yard?\n",
      "Yeah? Do you remember... any strange sounds or lights or anything like that?\n",
      "Can you tell me more about the Red Lightening?\n",
      "Had you ever seen anything like that before?\n",
      "Yeah? When?\n",
      "Why were these men after your Dad?\n",
      "It s like looking at a mirror image.\n",
      "Puncture wounds?\n",
      "That s Pacific standard time. That makes it the exact same moment.\n",
      "No. Serial killers seldom work in pairs. And when they do, they kill together not separately.\n",
      "Is Reardon s daughter nearby when he was murdered?\n",
      "When will they be back?\n",
      "Even money... she ll remember Red Lightening.\n",
      "Someone or something, Scully.\n",
      "Maybe they weren t looking in the right direction. (He points up.)\n",
      "You live here, Cindy?\n",
      "Cindy really is a beautiful little girl, Mrs. Reardon.\n",
      "Is she an only child?\n",
      "Was she the only child delivered at that birth?\n",
      "Mrs. Reardon, have you ever seen this man before?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No... he... he did... he didn t...\n",
      "In vitro fertilization?\n",
      "At which clinic?\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "I don t know. The only thing similar about these girls doesn t seem to be their appearance.\n",
      "Who both just happened to see their father s exsanguinated. I d like to get the odds on that in Vegas.\n",
      "One girl was just abducted.\n",
      "Potato, potahto.\n",
      "The murders were committed by the same person or persons. Part of the pattern involves kidnaping the daughter.\n",
      "I m going to keep an eye on the girl. You check out the clinic. See if the Simmons were enrolled in the same fertility program.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Maybe now she s trying to erase the results?\n",
      "So you think this is a vendetta that she and a colleague have against the Stapes Center?\n",
      "I ll tell you what... I m going to sleep on it and we ll talk about it in the morning.\n",
      "No, I m not.\n",
      "What s a girl?\n",
      "No, I have... there s a movie I want to watch on TV. Sleep tight. See you in the morning.\n",
      "Yes. What are you doing here?\n",
      "No you haven t.\n",
      "Agents Mulder and Scully. We re here to see Eve 6.\n",
      "What are those?\n",
      "Hello? (They see Eve 6 crouching in the corner on the floor with shackles. Eve 6 has dirty hair and yellow teeth. There are pictures on the wall.)\n",
      "They re probably there for a good reason.\n",
      "Where are the others? The other Adams and the Eves?\n",
      "Heightened psychosis.\n",
      "Dr. Kendrick was using the clinic to carry on the Lichfield Experiment. She was cloning herself.\n",
      "Suppose Eve 6 is right and there are two other Eves out there. That could account for the two identical murders occurring at exactly the same time. Sally Kendrick does have an accomplice. Herself.\n",
      "No. No, no, no. It seems the two remaining Eves are doing away with the parents in order to keep Teena and Cindy in the family.\n",
      "I hope not.\n",
      "I ll take the back.\n",
      "FBI. I m armed.\n",
      "Which one are you? Eve 7 or Eve 8?\n",
      "Mrs. Reardon, the fact that Kendrick and her accomplice murdered the fathers and abducted the girls means they want them alive. I m sure Cindy s alive and we ll find her.\n",
      "That was a motel manager in Port Reyes that says he s got a guest that matches Sally Kendrick s description.\n",
      "She might have ditched it. The manager said this woman checked in with a little girl. That she leaves the hotel in the afternoon by herself, was gone all night and returns the next day with the little girl.\n",
      "No, he remembers this kid. She told him he should use chlorine to irradiate the dinoflagellates in the swimming pool. Does that sound like someone we know?\n",
      "What did the other lady look like?\n",
      "Eve 8. They were working together.\n",
      "Their own mini Jonestown. Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide.\n",
      "Ah, maybe it would be better if we took responsibility for the girls.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Can you hold it?\n",
      "Hi. Where s your bathrooms?\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Oh, can I get four diet sodas?\n",
      "Okay, two diet and two regular. To go. Please.\n",
      "Those are the diet?\n",
      "Are you sure? These are really sweet.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Come on.\n",
      "How much?\n",
      "You want to pay?\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "You didn t pick up my keys off the counter, did you?\n",
      "All right. I ll be right back.\n",
      "SCULLY!\n",
      "I just wanted to open the car door for you.\n",
      "I only had a sip.\n",
      "SCULLY! I GOT THEM!\n",
      "SCULLY!\n",
      "Back off. We re federal agents.\n",
      "Forget your sodas?\n",
      "That s the last thing you are.\n",
      "They can t hide behind the bureaucracy, Mrs. Reardon. You have every right to know what happened. You have a right to know about your daughter.\n"
