## THE X FILES - Season 1 Sentiment-Analysis

- In this proyect, we created an API, in order to make sentiment analysis with the dialogues of the episodes from season 1 from The X Files. Also, the API can be used to add new episodes dialogues and new characters if you wish. First, we built a SQL data base with the dialogues of the main characters of The X Files, then we created the endpoints making queries to the data base.
